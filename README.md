# Pantone color libraries

Pantone color libraries as .acb files for Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator etc, downloaded with Pantone Color Manager in August 2019.

To use the colour libraries, copy the .acb files to the *Color Books* folder of the target application e.g. */Applications/Adobe Photoshop CC 2018/Presets/Color Books*, */Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2018/Presets/en_GB/Swatches/Color Books* or the equivalent *C:\Program Files\Adobe\etc* folder on Windows.
